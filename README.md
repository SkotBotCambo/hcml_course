# EECS 495 : Human-Centered Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
By definition, Machine Learning provides software with a way to learn something 
that it was not explicitly programmed for. 
In practice, Machine Learning is often used to allow **people** to learn something they might not 
have been able to do otherwise (e.g. infer relationships from 
large scale high-dimensional data at potentially high speed) and allow computers 
to learn something that humans learn naturally (e.g.: speaking, hearing, seeing). 
These two broad application areas of 
Machine Learning not only have a large impact on human behavior, their success 
often depends on a nuanced 
understanding of human behavior and how people interact with technology 
(i.e.: sociotechnical behavior). Students of 
the Human-Centered Machine Learning course will help form a new way of 
understanding and practicing the application of
machine learning through a series of readings, discussions, design and 
prototyping assignments, and a final project.

## Introduction

## Prerequisite Education
* At least one Human-Computer Interaction or Design Thinking course
	* Specifically a familiarity of human factors and the emprical methods used to uncover them
* Ability to program at a level appropriate for EECS 349 (Machine Learning)
	* Specifically, you should be able to comfortably write code in Python without help from the TA or Professor
* At least one Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or Data Science course
	* Specifically students should be comfortable applying methods for supervised and unsupervised learning in a software application of their design.

## Learning Objectives
Students who complete this course satisfactorally will:
* be comfortable discussing machine learning and artificial intelligence as part of a broader socio-technical system
* have an understanding of how the behavior of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms as well
as user task, intention, and understanding affect the overall user experience.

# Schedule
### Week 1 : Mental Models and Folk Theories
#### Discussion Prompt : 
* **How can Machine Learning make an aspect of life better?** Don't overthink this. It can realy be any aspect of anybody's life.
* **Can you think of an example of someone doing/attempting to do this?**
* **How do we evaluate this example's performance in making this aspect of life better?**

#### Readings :
* [Human-Centered Machine Learning (The Google Approach)](https://medium.com/google-design/human-centered-machine-learning-a770d10562cd) : *Josh Lovejoy*, *Jess Holbrook*
* [Human-Cent*r*ed Machine Learning (The Academic Approach)](https://medium.com/human-centered-machine-learning/what-is-human-centred-machine-learning-a2f8f8170f73)
